    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction  \n",
    "Sentiment analysis uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to  identify, extract, and analyse subjective information from text data. It is crucial in various  domains, including marketing, customer service, politics, and finance. In finance, sentiment  analysis is used to predict stock prices by analysing social media sentiment. By analysing social  media data, sentiment analysis can help investors and traders make more informed decisions  about buying or selling stocks. By understanding how people feel about a company, its  products, or its services, sentiment analysis can provide insight into consumer behaviour, which  can predict future stock prices.  \n",
    "You are required to analyse a dataset of the top 24 news headlines of each day for 1800 days  along with the stock prices of that day and come up with a model which can predict whether  the stock price of a day will go up or down.  \n",
    "Disclaimer: The dataset for this competition contains text that may be considered profane,  vulgar, or offensive. \n"

    "## The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First and foremost, data pre-processing needs to be done on both the datasets. You  must classify each day as 0 (stock prices went down) or 1 (stock prices went up). You are  not required to analyse the actual change in stock prices. Both datasets must be  combined into one in ascending order of dates.  \n",
    "a. Dataset of stock prices \n",
    "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14M1axE9kgo-2GNN6OuKWCjHi73kMQfIq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100343036315867584638&rtpof=true&sd=true\n",
    "b. Dataset of top 24 news headlines \n",
    "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i9jz6ZXHWcOasRsXkVjBm4pXPl44qkz-/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100343036315867584638&rtpof=true&sd=true\n",
    "2. After some more data pre-processing, go off and apply your NLP/ML model(s) \n",
    "to this  dataset. Divide the dataset into training/testing/etc, train your model(s), and get the  best accuracy possible.  \n"

    "## Evaluation  \n",
    "We will evaluate your submission on these three tasks -  \n",
    "1. Data pre-processing (15%)  \n",
    "2. Exploratory Data Analysis (25%)  \n",
    "3. Performance of your Model (60%)  \n",
    "The final score will comprise weights - 15% for Task-1, 25% for Task-2, 60% for Task-3. Your  code will be evaluated against the test dataset provided on a drive link and the obtained accuracy and other metrics will be checked. (You basically have to predict  whether stock prices went up or down when the top 24 news articles of an unknown new day  are given to you. We have our own testing dataset that is not provided to you here). \n"
